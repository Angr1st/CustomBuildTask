# CustomBuildTaskRepro
After I fixed the ps_module folder structure (removing the 0.11.0 and moving its contents directly into its parent folder) the build task works.
Also the task.ps1 shows you how to run another app using start-process cmdlet and using the correct options to retrieve its ExitCode.
